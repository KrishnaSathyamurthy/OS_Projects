# OS518
Project 1 is a refresher for the next 3 projects.
Project 2 is a user thread manager library, i.e., we "emulate" concurrency.
Project 3 is a user based memory manager, that is responsible for allocating, managing, and freeing memory.
Project 4 is a file system emulator built using FUSE library. This imitation is as close as it gets to what we see in a real OS.
